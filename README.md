This repository demonstrates a common error in R related to data frame subsetting using character vectors. The bug.r file showcases the incorrect implementation using the '%in%' operator, while bugSolution.r provides a more robust solution using 'grepl'. The issue stems from the sensitivity of '%in%' to minor variations in strings, potentially leading to incorrect subset selection. This is a frequent challenge for R users handling data that may contain inconsistencies or extra whitespace.
